# GRE_WordLookup

A very simple java project that looks up the meanings, synonyms, antonyms, example sentences with word usage for a list of provided words. 
The user selects if the the output is to be written into an html file, a spreadsheet, or other output formats.

This package can serve as a good class project for undergraduate students in computer science as an alternative to the banking and dating projects that are discarded soon after the completion of the class. Students can begin to re-se this project within a few months / year for the GRE exam they may need to take up.

I developed this package because as I was studying for the GRE, I would come up with several words I did not understand when taking up practice tests.
Upon completion of each practice test, I would compile a list of words I wanted to learn and provide it to this package. 

I developed this package before GitHub existed and only recently re-discovered it in my hard drive. 
I have gone through other GitHub GRE vocabulary building projects and I feel that this approach is unique and can be integrated with a flash-card / quizzing package. 
Incidentally, I remember building these features into the package but did not have time to complete them.
